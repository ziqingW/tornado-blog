## Nerd's thinking
### Gains:
- It was my first time to use Python to build a real website (most likely)
- First time to use database in a dynamic app

### Pains:
- As an early work for my website project, the login system was lame
- Currently, it only supports administrator to add posts
- Some designs of it were clumsy, especially, the 'slug' part

## Major Techs:
- Python
- Tornado
- Jinja2
- PostgreSQL
